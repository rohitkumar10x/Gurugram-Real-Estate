# 🏠 Real Estate Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis on a real estate dataset to understand property pricing trends.

The goal of this project is to analyze different factors that affect property prices such as locality, flat type, builder, area, RERA approval, and construction status.

- Price
- Area (Sqft)
- Rate per Sqft
- Locality
- Flat Type
